# Testcase Example:  '"anagram"\n"nagaram"'
#
# Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false
# otherwise.
# 
# An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a
# different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly
# once.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
# Output: true
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
# Output: false
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4
# s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up: What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt
# your solution to such a case?
#

            countS[s[i]] = 1 + countS.get(s[i], 0)
            countT[t[i]] = 1 + countT.get(s[i], 0)
        for c in countS:
            if countS[c] != countT.get(c,0):
                return True
        return False
